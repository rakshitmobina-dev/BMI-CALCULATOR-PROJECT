● Problem statement :
The BMI calculator project aims to create a simple tool that calculates a person's Body Mass Index (BMI) using their height and weight. 
It then classifies their weight status as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese based on the BMI value. This helps individuals quickly assess their 
health risk related to body weight without manual calculations, providing accurate and easy-to-understand results. The goal is to make the calculation 
user-friendly, with proper input validation and clear output.

● Scope of the project :
The scope of the BMI calculator project is to develop a simple, user-friendly tool that calculates Body Mass Index from height and weight inputs, 
classifies weight status, and provides users with clear health-related feedback. It focuses on accurate BMI calculation, easy input and output handling, 
and accessibility across devices. The project aims to raise health awareness by enabling individuals to monitor their weight status quickly and make informed lifestyle choices.
It does not provide medical diagnoses but serves as a basic health assessment aid.

● Target users :
The BMI calculator is a simple and fast tool that helps users determine if their body weight is healthy relative to their height. By entering weight and height, it calculates
a BMI value and classifies the user as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. This gives quick insight into potential health risks related to body weight. 
While not a perfect measure of body fat or health, it is widely used as a basic screening tool to raise awareness and guide lifestyle or medical decisions. 
The calculator is easy to use, accessible online or offline, and serves as a starting point for discussions about weight and health.

● High-level features :
1)User input for weight (kg) and height (m) with input validation to handle incorrect or invalid entries.
2)Calculation of BMI using the standard formula: BMI = weight / (height^2).
3)Classification of BMI into categories: Underweight, Normal Weight, Overweight, and Obese based on WHO standards.
4)Clear display of the BMI score and corresponding classification to the user.
5)Error handling with informative messages for invalid inputs.
6)Simple and interactive user interface suitable for console or basic GUI.
7)Portable, requiring no external dependencies, scalable for integration into larger health or fitness applications.
